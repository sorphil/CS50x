                A prototype of what my final project will hopefully turn out to be; a database that will store information about
                indie developers/musicians/film-makers and link pages to their work and stuff like reviews.
                Like IndieDB but actually for everything indie, not just video games. For now it's an empty page that (maybe?) looks pretty.
            </p>

                 And also, look at that logo at the top. It's clickable and all. Pretty neat, eh?
