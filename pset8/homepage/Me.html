                Hey y'all. I'm Philip Soriano, a Filipino currently residing in the Middle East. I'm monolingual, though I can cuss fairly well
                in both Hindi and Arabic. Long jogs, cooking, reading fantasy-fiction, jazz noodling in my guitar is what my days are mostly comprised of.
                I also ocassionally dabble in reading some psycho-analytic literature, maybe some philosophpy and western history too when I get the chance,
                I know, super pretentious right?
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLthw2YWb4s">YA LIKE JAZZ?</a> Cause I certainly do. Roy Hargrove, Christian Mcbride, Herbie
                Hancock or some older folks like Oscar Peterson and John Coltrane, oof, boy are they super neat. I also enjoy some funk stuff like the Johnson
                Brothers, George Duke, and Kool & the Gang. RnB and Hip-Hop are pretty cool too. Listen to em' in this neat embedded playlist. <br>

                As a kid growing up in a small run-down area in the capital of the Philippines, there wasn't much to do to pass the time other than
                play video games or be in front of the computer screen all day. That sort of instilled the fascination I've had with anything pertaining
                to tech and few things excited me as a child than successfully installing freeware on our family desktop.

             Despite being born past the era of retro videogames, my family's financial position only allowed me to get consoles made decades
             before my time. When everyone was getting their hands on the latest stuff like PS3s and Xbox360s, I had a Nintendo Game Boy Color,
             Playstation 1 and a Sega Dreamcast playing lowpoly and pixelated video games when 3D cel-shaded graphics was all the rage; which was essentially responsible for my love and passion for retro games. And since most of the video game industry
             hardly make games of the genre I love so much, indie games was what sort of filled that gap. Discovering the people behind
             these games however was something else altogether, and was what primarily motivated me to create this site in the first place; an
             homage to the folks who do not compromise artistic expression for profit, and the same could be same for other independent artists.
