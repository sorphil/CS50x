   /* use fread (data, size, number, inptr)
      data = pointer to where you'll store data that you're reading
      size = size of each element ie 1 byte, 2 bytes, etc.
      number = number of elements
      inptr = File * that you actually want to read from

       to check for jpeg for each 512 byte block
       byte buffer[0] == 0xff
       byte buffer[1] == 0xd8
       byte buffer[2] == 0xff
       for the fourth byte, we can use bitwise arithmetic function & (ie bitwise AND)
       Bitwise operators function as such
       1110 & 1000 = 1000, or 1110 | 1000 = 1110.

       For this 8-bit byte we have, ie 0xf0 = 11110000 (ie ignoring the first four bits)
       Comparing it with our buffer[3] if it has the desired results, (ie 0xe* where * = 1 to F) 111----
       Then using a bitwise AND on these two, we get 00010000 or e0, ie regardless if its 1 to F, we'll always
       get e0 as the result

       byte buffer[3] & 0xf0 == 0xe0

       Making a jpeg file
       ###.jpg using digits

       To keep track of the number of jpegs
       sprintf (filename , "%03i.jpg", 2)  %03i. means print an integer with 3 digits and "2" is what you want to
       replace it with

       Create file name
       File *img = fopen(filename, "w") //meaning write

       To write data on a file, use fwrite (data, size, number, outptr)
       data = pointer of bytes you want to write on the file
       size = size of each element
       number = number of elements
       outptr = File* that you want to write in

       To detect end of the file
       fread() returns number of size "size"

       Pseudocode
       1) Open memory card
       2) Repeat until end of card
       3) Read 512 bytes into a buffer
       4) If start of new JPEG
            -) if first JPEG
            -) else go to another file
       5) If not the start of a new JPEG
       6) IF at the end, close any remaining files
